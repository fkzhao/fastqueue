# Fast Queue


A fast and persistent queue based on memory mapped file.

***Notice***, fast queue is just a standalone library, for a high-throughput, persistent, distributed, publish-subscribe messaging system.

## Feature Highlight:
1. **Fast**: close to the speed of direct memory access, both enqueue and dequeue are close to O(1) memory access.
2. **Big**: the total size of the queue is only limited by the available disk space.
3. **Persistent**: all data in the queue is persisted on disk, and is crash resistant.
4. **Reliable**: OS will be responsible to persist the produced messages even your process crashes.
5. **Realtime**: messages produced by producer threads will be immediately visible to consumer threads.
6. **Memory-efficient**: automatic paging & swapping algorithm, only most-recently accessed data is kept in memory.
7. **Thread-safe**: multiple threads can concurrently enqueue and dequeue without data corruption.
8. **Simple&Light-weight**: current number of source files is 12 and the library jar is less than 30K.
